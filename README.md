# Gaussian Mixture Variational Autoencoders
This project aims at unsupervised clustering through generative models. Thus a variational autoencoder is trained to cluster data in its encoder. Instead of an isotropic gaussian prior, the input is considered to be composed of a mixture of K gaussians, K being the number of clusters the data may posses.

This project is based on the paper:</br>
